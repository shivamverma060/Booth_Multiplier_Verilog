# Booth_Multiplier_Verilog

Booth multiplier is a digital circuit that multiplies two binary numbers. It is a more efficient way to multiply binary numbers than the traditional method of multiplying each digit pairwise. Booth multiplier works by converting the multiplicand and multiplier into Booth form, which is a simplified representation of the binary numbers that makes multiplication easier.

The Booth multiplication algorithm works as follows:

The multiplicand and multiplier are converted into Booth form.
The Booth form of the multiplier is scanned from right to left.
For each pair of bits in the Booth form of the multiplier, the following is done:
If the two bits are the same, the partial product is shifted one bit to the left.
If the two bits are different, the partial product is shifted one bit to the left and the multiplicand is added or subtracted, depending on the value of the two bits.
The final product is the sum of all the partial products.
The Booth multiplication algorithm can be implemented in hardware using a variety of different circuits. The simplest implementation is a sequential circuit that scans the Booth form of the multiplier one bit at a time. More complex implementations can use parallel circuits to speed up the multiplication process.

Booth multiplier is a versatile circuit that can be used in a variety of different applications. It is commonly used in digital signal processors (DSPs), where it is used to multiply the coefficients of a digital filter. Booth multiplier is also used in cryptography, where it is used to multiply large numbers quickly.
